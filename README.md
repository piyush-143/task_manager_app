# task_manager_app
<p>
I have developed a Task Manager App using the Flutter framework based on Dart language. For state management, I have used the provider.
</br></br>
->This app contains the features of adding a new task, editing the selected task, and deleting the task, the priority of the task can be selected at the time of creation and can be edited later. </br> ->On the home screen, the task with red colors shows the task with high priority, yellow colors shows the task with medium priority, and green color shows the task with low priority.
</br>
</br>
This app contains the following directory:- 
</br>
 view - In the view I have made the Ui-related thing.
 </br>
 view_model - The view model contains the logic and state management using the provider.
 </br>
 custom_widgets - It contains everything that was used more than once.
 </br>
 utils - The utils contain the utility widget like an error message.
